# Digital Ocean (Docker Machine)

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a Prisma [cluster](!alias-eu2ood0she) on Digital Ocean and deploy your Prisma services to it.

[Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) is an easy-to-use provider of virtual servers. They offer different computation units, called [Droplets](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/).

<InfoBox>

The setup described in this section does not include features you would normally expect from production-ready servers, such as _automated backups_ and _active failover_. We will add more guides in the future describing a more complete setup suitable for production use.

</InfoBox>

## 1. Install Docker & Docker Machine

The first thing you need to is install Docker and Docker Machine. The easiest way to install theses tools is by following the step in the Docker Docs directly.

<Instruction>

Follow the instructions (step 1 through 3) at [https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/#install-machine-directly](https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/#install-machine-directly) to install Docker as well as  Docker Machine.

</Instruction>

Once you're done, you should be able to run the following command which will output the version of `docker-machine`:

```sh
docker-machine -v
```

## 2. Register at Digital Ocean

<Instruction>

If you haven't already, you need to start by creating an account at for Digital Ocean. You can do so [here](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/registrations/new).

</Instruction>

Once you have your account available, you need to generate a personal access token which is needed to create your Droplet.

<Instruction>

Folle the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/machine/examples/ocean/#step-2-generate-a-personal-access-token) to obtain your personal access token.

Make sure to save the token, you'll need it in the next step.

</Instruction>

## 3. Create your Digital Ocean Droplet

You can now go ahead and create your Droplet. The personal access token from the previous step will be used to associate the Droplet your with Digital Ocean account.

<Instruction>

In your terminal, use [`docker-machine create`](https://docs.docker.com/machine/reference/create/) to create your Droplet using the [`digitalocean`](https://docs.docker.com/machine/drivers/digital-ocean/) driver. Note that you need to replace the `__TOKEN__` placeholder with your personal access token from the previous step:

```sh
docker-machine create --driver digitalocean --digitalocean-access-token __TOKEN__ --digitalocean-size 1gb prisma
```

</Instruction>

The `--digitalocean-size 1gb` argument indicates that the Droplet receives 1GB of memory. The last argument of the command, `prisma`, determines the _name_ of the Droplet.

You will now have a running Droplet that can be controlled by `docker-machine`. You can list your current Droplets by running the following command:

```sh
docker-machine ls
```

## 4. Install Prisma on your Droplet

Now that you have your Droplet up-and-running, you can install Prisma on it. As [the Prisma infrastructure runs on Docker](!alias-aira9zama5), you could theoretically do this by using the Docker CLI directly. In that case, you could use the [Docker Compose file](!alias-aira9zama5#docker-compose-file) as foundation and run the required commands (e.g. [`docker-compose up`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/up/)) yourself.

However, the Prisma CLI actually offers some commands that you can use for convenience to not fiddle with Docker yourself. In this tutorial, you'll take advantage of these commands - under the hood they will simply configure your Docker environment and invoke the required CLI commands.

The `docker` CLI is a client that allows to create and manage your Docker containers on a dedicated _host_ machine. By default, that host machine is your local machine (`localhost`). However, using `docker-machine` you can _point_ the `docker` CLI to run against a different host. Meaning that all your `docker` commands (including `docker-compose`) can be executed to a remote machine over the internet.

So, the next step is to make sure your `docker` commands actually run against the remote Digital Ocean Droplet you just created. You can do so by setting a number of environment variables that'll be used by `docker`. But how do you know _which_ environment variables - and what values to set? `docker-machine` to the rescue!

The following command prints the correct environment variables for you to set - in fact it even prints the commands that you need to execute in your terminal in order to set them correctly. Thank you `docker-machine`! üôè

```sh
docker-machine env prisma
```

The output of that command looks somewhat similar to the following (depending on your shell and OS the commands to set environment variables might differ):

```sh
$ docker-machine env prisma
export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY="1"
export DOCKER_HOST="tcp://104.132.24.246:2376"
export DOCKER_CERT_PATH="/Users/johndoe/.docker/machine/machines/prisma"
export DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME="prisma"
# Run this command to configure your shell:
# eval $(docker-machine env prisma)
```

<Instruction>

Copy the last line of that output, excluding the `#` in the beginning (which indicates a comment) and paste it into your terminal:

```sh
eval $(docker-machine env prisma)
```

</Instruction>

That's it - all your `docker` (and therefore `prisma local`) commands will now run against the Digital Ocean Droplet instead of your local machine!

To actually install Prisma on your Droplet, you need to perform the following steps (we'll go over them in detail afterwards):

1. Create `docker-compose.yml` with proper configuration
1. Create `.env` to configure the environment variables used by Docker
1. Run `docker-compose up` to install Prisma on the Droplet

Let's get started!

<Instruction>

First, go ahead and create a new directory on your file system where you'll place all the files for your project, you can call it `digital-ocean-demo`.

</Instruction>

<Instruction>

Inside that directory, create a new file called `docker-compose.yml` and copy the following contents into it:

```yml(path="digital-ocean-demo/docker-compose.yml")
version: "3"
services:
  prisma-db:
    image: mysql:5.7
    container_name: prisma-db
    networks:
      - prisma
    restart: always
    command: mysqld --max-connections=1000 --sql-mode="ALLOW_INVALID_DATES,ANSI_QUOTES,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,HIGH_NOT_PRECEDENCE,IGNORE_SPACE,NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO,NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES,NO_DIR_IN_CREATE,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION,NO_FIELD_OPTIONS,NO_KEY_OPTIONS,NO_TABLE_OPTIONS,NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION,NO_ZERO_DATE,NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY,PIPES_AS_CONCAT,REAL_AS_FLOAT,STRICT_ALL_TABLES,STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,ANSI,DB2,MAXDB,MSSQL,MYSQL323,MYSQL40,ORACLE,POSTGRESQL,TRADITIONAL"
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: $SQL_INTERNAL_PASSWORD
      MYSQL_DATABASE: $SQL_INTERNAL_DATABASE
    ports:
      - "3306:3306" # Temporary/debug mapping to the host
    volumes:
      - db-persistence:/var/lib/mysql

  prisma-database:
    image: prismagraphql/prisma:1.0
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "0.0.0.0:${PORT}:${PORT}"
    networks:
      - prisma
    environment:
      PORT: $PORT
      SCHEMA_MANAGER_SECRET: $SCHEMA_MANAGER_SECRET
      SCHEMA_MANAGER_ENDPOINT: $SCHEMA_MANAGER_ENDPOINT
      SQL_CLIENT_HOST_CLIENT1: $SQL_CLIENT_HOST
      SQL_CLIENT_HOST_READONLY_CLIENT1: $SQL_CLIENT_HOST
      SQL_CLIENT_HOST: $SQL_CLIENT_HOST
      SQL_CLIENT_PORT: $SQL_CLIENT_PORT
      SQL_CLIENT_USER: $SQL_CLIENT_USER
      SQL_CLIENT_PASSWORD: $SQL_CLIENT_PASSWORD
      SQL_CLIENT_CONNECTION_LIMIT: 10
      SQL_INTERNAL_HOST: $SQL_INTERNAL_HOST
      SQL_INTERNAL_PORT: $SQL_INTERNAL_PORT
      SQL_INTERNAL_USER: $SQL_INTERNAL_USER
      SQL_INTERNAL_PASSWORD: $SQL_INTERNAL_PASSWORD
      SQL_INTERNAL_DATABASE: $SQL_INTERNAL_DATABASE
      CLUSTER_ADDRESS: $CLUSTER_ADDRESS
      SQL_INTERNAL_CONNECTION_LIMIT: 10
      CLUSTER_PUBLIC_KEY: $CLUSTER_PUBLIC_KEY
      BUGSNAG_API_KEY: ""
      ENABLE_METRICS: "0"
      JAVA_OPTS: "-Xmx1G"

networks:
  prisma:
    driver: bridge

volumes:
  db-persistence:
```

</Instruction>

<Instruction>

Next, create another file that you call `.env`. Then paste the following contents into it:

```(path="digital-ocean-demo/.env")
PORT=4466
CLUSTER_ADDRESS=http://prisma-database:${PORT}
CLUSTER_PUBLIC_KEY=PUBLIC_KEY

SQL_CLIENT_HOST=prisma-db
SQL_CLIENT_PORT=3306
SQL_CLIENT_USER=root
SQL_CLIENT_PASSWORD=__SECRET_2__
SQL_CLIENT_CONNECTION_LIMIT=10

SQL_INTERNAL_HOST=prisma-db
SQL_INTERNAL_PORT=3306
SQL_INTERNAL_USER=root
SQL_INTERNAL_PASSWORD=__SECRET_2__
SQL_INTERNAL_DATABASE=graphcool
SQL_INTERNAL_CONNECTION_LIMIT=10
```

</Instruction>

> **Note**: To learn more about the variables configured here, check the corresponding [reference docs](!alias-aira9zama5#structure).

With these files in place, you can go ahead and install Prisma!

<Instruction>

Inside the `digital-ocean-demo` directory, run the following command:

```sh(path="digital-ocean-demo")
docker-compose up -d
```

</Instruction>

Remember that thanks to Docker Machine, this command will now run against the remote host, i.e. your Digital Ocean Droplet.








<!-- 

Now you need to copy the Configuration files for Prisma Cluster. In a new folder create the two files:

> .env

```
PORT=4466
SCHEMA_MANAGER_SECRET=SECRET_1
SCHEMA_MANAGER_ENDPOINT=http://prisma-database:${PORT}/cluster/schema
CLUSTER_ADDRESS=http://prisma-database:${PORT}
CLUSTER_PUBLIC_KEY=PUBLIC_KEY

SQL_CLIENT_HOST=prisma-db
SQL_CLIENT_PORT=3306
SQL_CLIENT_USER=root
SQL_CLIENT_PASSWORD=SECRET_2
SQL_CLIENT_CONNECTION_LIMIT=10

SQL_INTERNAL_HOST=prisma-db
SQL_INTERNAL_PORT=3306
SQL_INTERNAL_USER=root
SQL_INTERNAL_PASSWORD=SECRET_2
SQL_INTERNAL_DATABASE=graphcool
SQL_INTERNAL_CONNECTION_LIMIT=10
```

> docker-compose.yml

```yml
version: "3"
services:
  prisma-db:
    container_name: prisma-db
    image: mysql:5.7
    networks:
      - prisma
    restart: always

    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: $SQL_INTERNAL_PASSWORD
      MYSQL_DATABASE: $SQL_INTERNAL_DATABASE
    ports:
      - "3306:3306" # Temporary/debug mapping to the host
    volumes:
      - db-persistence:/var/lib/mysql

  prisma:
    image: prismagraphql/prisma:1.0.0-beta4.2
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "0.0.0.0:${PORT}:${PORT}"
    networks:
      - prisma
    environment:
      PORT: $PORT
      SCHEMA_MANAGER_SECRET: $SCHEMA_MANAGER_SECRET
      SCHEMA_MANAGER_ENDPOINT: $SCHEMA_MANAGER_ENDPOINT
      SQL_CLIENT_HOST_CLIENT1: $SQL_CLIENT_HOST
      SQL_CLIENT_HOST_READONLY_CLIENT1: $SQL_CLIENT_HOST
      SQL_CLIENT_HOST: $SQL_CLIENT_HOST
      SQL_CLIENT_PORT: $SQL_CLIENT_PORT
      SQL_CLIENT_USER: $SQL_CLIENT_USER
      SQL_CLIENT_PASSWORD: $SQL_CLIENT_PASSWORD
      SQL_CLIENT_CONNECTION_LIMIT: 10
      SQL_INTERNAL_HOST: $SQL_INTERNAL_HOST
      SQL_INTERNAL_PORT: $SQL_INTERNAL_PORT
      SQL_INTERNAL_USER: $SQL_INTERNAL_USER
      SQL_INTERNAL_PASSWORD: $SQL_INTERNAL_PASSWORD
      SQL_INTERNAL_DATABASE: $SQL_INTERNAL_DATABASE
      CLUSTER_ADDRESS: $CLUSTER_ADDRESS
      SQL_INTERNAL_CONNECTION_LIMIT: 10
      CLUSTER_PUBLIC_KEY: $CLUSTER_PUBLIC_KEY
      BUGSNAG_API_KEY: ""
      CLUSTER_VERSION: 1.0.0-beta4.2

networks:
  prisma:
    driver: bridge

volumes:
  db-persistence:
```

In `.env`, replace `SECRET_1` and `SECRET_2` (occurs twice) with a long and secure random string.

Now you are ready to use `docker-compose` to start your Prisma cluster:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

## Enable Cluster Security

By default, anyone can connect to the new cluster using the Prisma CLI and deploy services. To lock down access, you need to configure a public/private keypair.

```
openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem
```

This will generate two files `private.pem` and `public.pem`

Copy the output of the following command to the `.env` file and replace `PUBLIC_KEY`:

```sh
cat public.pem | sed -n -e 'H;${x;s/\n/\\\\r\\\\n/g;p;}'
```

open ~/.prisma/config.yml in your favourite editor. It is likely that you already have one or more clusters defined in this file. Add another cluster and give it a descriptive name. For example `do-cluster`:

```yml
clusters:
  local:
    host: 'http://localhost:4466'
    clusterSecret: "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- [ long key omitted ] -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\r\n"
  do-cluster:
    host: 'http://45.55.177.154:4466'
    clusterSecret: "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- [ long key omitted ] -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\r\n"
```

Change the host to use the ip of your Digital Ocean Droplet.

Copy the output of the following command and replace the content of `clusterSecret` for the new cluster:

```sh
cat private.pem | sed -n -e 'H;${x;s/\n/\\\\r\\\\n/g;p;}'
```

to restart the Prisma cluster:

```
docker-compose kill
docker-compose up -d
```

## Deploy a service

On your local machine, verify that the cluster configuration is being picked up correctly:

```sh
prisma cluster list
```

The output should include your newly added cluster.

Now you can create a new service and deploy it to the cluster:

```
prisma init
prisma deploy
```

Pick the new cluster in the deployment option. You should see output similar to this:

```
Added cluster: do-cluster to prisma.yml
Creating stage dev for service demo ‚úî
Deploying service `demo` to stage `dev` on cluster `do-cluster` 1.3s
